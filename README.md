# Decision-Tree-SVM-For-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
## Objective:

Developed a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, improving detection accuracy while addressing class imbalance in the dataset.

## Technologies and Tools:

- Programming Languages: Python
- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Machine Learning Algorithms: Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Data Preprocessing: Standardization, Normalization, Train/Test Split
- Evaluation Metrics: ROC-AUC Score, Hinge Loss

## Project Overview:

### Data Preparation: 
- Worked with a large dataset of credit card transactions, initially inflating the dataset by replicating observations to increase the sample size.
- Performed data preprocessing steps such as feature scaling (using StandardScaler), normalization, and handling class imbalance by computing sample weights.
### Modeling: 
- Implemented and trained a Decision Tree Classifier and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent. 
- Ensured model robustness and fairness by adjusting for class imbalance through sample weighting and by stratifying the dataset during train/test split.
### Performance Evaluation: 
Evaluated the models using ROC-AUC score, which reflects the model's ability to distinguish between classes, and hinge loss, which measures the modelâ€™s prediction margin. The models demonstrated strong performance, with notable accuracy and efficiency in detecting fraudulent transactions.

## Business Impact:

- Enhanced Fraud Detection: Successfully developed a machine learning model that can significantly improve the detection of fraudulent transactions, potentially reducing financial losses for businesses.
- Operational Efficiency: The project showcased the ability to handle large datasets and imbalanced classes, ensuring that the fraud detection model could be efficiently scaled and deployed in real-world scenarios.
- Data-Driven Insights: Provided actionable insights into transaction patterns and fraud indicators, which can be leveraged to fine-tune fraud detection strategies and improve overall financial security.
